Covid-19: The story of a pandemic</b><br>
A timeline of the coronavirus pandemic, from the first cases in China in December 2019 to 300 million vaccine doses delivered (and counting)</font><br></p>

<p><u><br><font color="blue">HEALTH March 10, 2021 18:11</font><br></u></p>

A year ago this week, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared covid-19 a pandemic. Since the first case of infection with this new coronavirus was reported in China in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, as we now know it to be called, has killed over 2.5 million people and infected at least 116 million. Beginning as an unexplained, pneumonia-like illness, first detected in China’s Wuhan province, it has since spread to almost every country, bringing life across most of the world to a near-standstill for the last year. World leaders became ill, entire countries were locked down to prevent the spread of infection and international travel ceased.

As most governments struggled to contain the virus, scientists were rushing to identify and find treatments that worked against covid-19. As infections surged worldwide, new, highly transmissible variants of the virus were identified and are circulating ever further.

With many vaccines now approved, over 300 million doses have been administered, and over 65 million people are now fully vaccinated. But this represents less than 1 per cent of the world’s population, and while the vaccine offers a glimmer of hope for a return to normal, there is still a long way to go. As countries, including the UK, are prepring to lift restrictions, we look back at a year that changed the world forever.</p>
